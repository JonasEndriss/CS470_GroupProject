# CS470_GroupProject
The final project of group P10 for Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (CS470) at KAIST.

## Description
Potatoes are a critical crop globally, ranking as the third most important food source after rice and wheat. However, plant diseases are a significant threat to potato crops. The goal of this group project is to design an optimized deep learning algorithm for potato blight detection. To ensure the best performances possible, we will design our algorithm based on the Waterwheel Plant Algorithm and the Sine Cosine Algorithm.
