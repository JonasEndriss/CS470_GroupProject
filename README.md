# CS470_GroupProject
The final project of group P10 for Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (CS470) at KAIST.

## Description
Potatoes are a critical crop globally, ranking as the third most important food source after rice and wheat. However, plant diseases are a significant threat to potato crops. The goal of this group project is to design an optimized deep learning algorithm for potato blight detection. To ensure the best performances possible, we will design our algorithm based on the Waterwheel Plant Algorithm and the Sine Cosine Algorithm.

## Group Members
- Jonas Endriss
- Léo Hof
- Théo Archaud
- Raghad Almaghrabi
- Eric Wang

## Dataset
We are using the [Potato Leaf Disease Data set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammadardiputra/potato-leaf-disease-dataset/data) provided by Muhammad Ardi Putra

## For Ta's
To reproduce our code two files are relevant:
 - src/WWPASC_further_analysis.ipynb
    - This is the implementation of the project on the original dataset.
 - src/different_dataset_model_from_paper_no_improvements.ipynb
    - This is the implementation of the project on a differnet dataset that contains more types of illnesses.
The rest of the files were mostly created during development and dont contain any final versions.
